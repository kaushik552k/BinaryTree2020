This repository has shown the demonstration of binary tree


A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children generally referred as left child and right child.

Each node contains three components:

Pointer to left subtree
Pointer to right subtree
Data element
The topmost node in the tree is called the root. An empty tree is represented by NULL pointer.
